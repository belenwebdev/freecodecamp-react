                Hello! My name is Belen Carrion. Iâ€™m a web developer based in Madrid, Spain

            <p>
                From a young age I have been interested in technology and computers in particular. Growing up, I knew this was the career I wanted to pursue and graduated from Computer Science Engineering. I later completed my masters in Computer Science and Technology. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And since then, I have been working as a full stack web developer, building web applications for multiple purposes using different technologies.
